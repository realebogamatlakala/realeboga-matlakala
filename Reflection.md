Transitioning from requirement analysis to Agile planning was both challenging and insightful. This process required breaking down functional requirements into user stories,
prioritizing them in a backlog, and selecting tasks for the first sprint. This reflection will cover the challenges faced, lessons learned, and key takeaways from this Agile exercise.

Challenges Faced
1. Writing Effective User Stories
Crafting user stories using the INVEST principles (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable) was difficult at first. Ensuring each story provided clear business value while remaining small and testable required multiple iterations.
For example, the story "As an employee, I want to log work hours so that I can track my time" was straightforward. However, defining acceptance criteria—such as handling overlapping time entries and invalid inputs—required additional clarity.

2. Prioritization with MoSCoW
Deciding what was a Must-have versus a Should-have was challenging. Features like Logging Time and Approvals were obviously crucial, but others—like Automated Notifications—could enhance the user experience without being part of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product).
To prioritize, I asked:

Does this feature directly support the core goal of time tracking?

Can users perform critical tasks without this feature?

3. Estimating Effort (Story Points & Sprint Planning)
Agile teams often use Fibonacci Story Points (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.) for effort estimation. Since this is a solo project, estimating complexity without prior sprint data was tricky.

Simple UI tasks were 2 points.

Medium complexity tasks were 3 points.

Backend-heavy tasks were 5 points due to dependencies.

Predicting actual development time for user authentication, database design, and payroll integration required careful dependency mapping.

4. Sprint Scope & Task Breakdown
Defining a realistic sprint goal for a two-week timeframe was difficult. I originally considered more user stories, but focusing on Logging Time, Approvals, Payroll Export, and Authentication made the sprint more achievable.
Breaking stories into tasks (e.g., "Develop API," "Design UI," "Setup Database") helped organize work into manageable units while ensuring all dependencies were covered.
